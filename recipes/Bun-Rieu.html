    </ul>
    <h4><b>Directions</b></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the bones: In a large stock pot, add water (enough to cover bones once added). Add salt. Bring pot to a boil. Add the bones and cook for 5 minute.</li>
        <li>Drain bones into a colander and rinse thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Clean pot thoroughly and add water (5 liters). Bring pot to a boil. Add cleaned bones. Simmer on low for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large sauce pan, heat vegetable oil and saute garlic and shallots. Once fragrant and lightly brown, add tomatoes and fried tofu. Stir gently and cook for 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Liquefy the shrimp paste with a little bit of water from the stock pot. Then add it to the sauce pan.</li>
        <li>To add the signature red in Bun Rieu, add ketchup and stir gently until combined. (Traditionally, red annatto seeds are fried in oil to release its red color. The seeds are discarded and the red oil is added to the stock pot)</li>
        <li>Add the tomato/fried tofu base to the stock pot.</li>
        <li>Put the dried shrimp in a food processor and chop finely. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same sauce pan used previously, heat vegetable oil on high.</li>
        <li>Add shallot and garlic. Saute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add minced crab in spices. Saute the mixture around until it becomes fragrant. Let the mixture cool completely before proceeding.</li>
        <li>Add the dried shrimp, eggs, salt, pepper, MSG and pork stock powder. Mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Turn up the heat on the stock pot to a rolling boil. Then slowly pour the mixture into the stock pot. You want the riêu to cook up fast and float to the top.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to a low simmer and cook for another 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add noodles to a bowl. You can microwave the noodles if it has already cooled.</li>
        <li>Add in the soup, pork and riêu.</li>
        <li>Add in your favorite veggies, a squeeze of lime and a sprinkle of green onions.</li>
    </ol>
