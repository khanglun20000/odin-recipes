    <h4><b>Ingredients</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 lbs beef and/or pork bones (neck bones, hocks, knuckles, spare ribs or oxtail)        </li>

        <li>2 lbs boneless pork shank</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 stick Vietnamese ham (Cha Lua/Gio Lua; slice thin)</li>
        <li>4 liters water</li>
        <li>3 stalks lemongrass (160 grams; discard tough outer leaves, trim of woody green leafy ends and stem; cut in half; lightly smash with mallet; use one rough outer leaf to tie lemongrass into a bundle)</li>
        <li>2 white/yellow onions (150 grams total; peel)</li>
        <li>1 small chunk ginger (50 grams, lightly smash with mallet)</li>
        <li>A quarter of very ripe pineapple (200 grams</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sea salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon MSG (optional)</li>
        <li>1-1/2 lbs congealed uncooked pork blood</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 shallot (peel and lightly smash with mallet)</li>
        <li>1 golf-ball size ginger (50 grams, lightly smash with mallet)</li>
        <li>2 14-oz package dried extra-large rice vermicelli (usually labeled Bun Bo Hue noodles)</li>
        <li>1 small white/yellow onion (peel and thinly slice)</li>
        <li>3 green onions (thinly slice)</li>
        <li>Small bunch cilantro (roughly chop)</li>
        <li>Vietnamese sate sauce (chili oil with shallots, garlic and lemongrass)</li>
        <li>1/2 lb bean sprouts</li>
        <li>1 small banana blossom (remove rough outer leaves, slice thin and immediately place in water with juice of 1 lime/lemon to prevent darkening)</li>
        <li>1 head lettuce (slice thin)</li>
        <li>1 lime/lemon (cut into wedges)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><b>Directions</b></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the bones and meat: To a large stockpot, add bones and boneless shanks (do not include the Vietnamese ham!) and 2 teaspoons salt. Cover with water and heat on high. When the pot reaches a rolling boil and impurities float to the top, turn off the heat. Place a colander in the sink and drain the contents of the pot into the colander. Thoroughly rinse bones/meat under cold running water and drain dry. If using boneless pork shank, wrap up meat into a tight bundle with twine. This will make it easier to slice when it's finished cooking. Wash the pot thoroughly and return it to the stove. Transfer parboiled bones/meat to the pot and fill with water (4 liters). Add lemongrass bundle, white/yellow onions, ginger, and pineapple. Heat on medium-high/low simmer for 2 hours. Occasionally skim the surface of the stock to keep it clear.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, cook the pork blood. Remove pork blood from its container by cutting the seal between the pork blood and container with a long knife. Gently tilt container sideways to slide out pork blood into a large bowl then cut into cubes. Fill a small pot with 3 inches of water. Add salt, shallot, and ginger. Heat pot to a low simmer. Add pork blood and cook for one hour. The low heat will prevent a honeycomb texture. After one hour, drain and rinse pork blood with cold running water. Store cooked pork blood in water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Back to the stockpot: After one hour of cooking, check the boneless shank for doneness by piercing it with a chopstick. It's done when chopstick pierces easily and water runs clear. Remove and discard all bones, but if you are using knuckles and hocks, do not discard. They are commonly used as a meaty topping. Transfer all knuckles, hocks to an iced bath to cool. Leave the other aromatics in the stockpot for now. When knuckles, hocks and boneless shanks are cooled completely, remove them from the iced bath. For boneless shanks, cut them into thin circular slices and set aside. For any large hocks and knuckles that are too big, cut them into bite-size pieces and set aside. Continue to cook the stock with the aromatics for another hour on a low simmer (2 hours total).</li>
        <li>Remove all solids from the stockpot. Season stock with chicken stock powder, fish sauce, sea salt, sugar, and MSG (optional). Make the stock fiery red by adding 2-3 tablespoons of sate sauce. You can leave the sate sauce out of the stock and serve it on the side instead.</li>
        <li>In a medium-size stockpot, cook the noodles for 20 minutes or until soft (disregard package instructions of cooking for only 3-5 minutes. I typically find that's not long enough!). Place a colander in the sink and drain noodles into the colander. Rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>To assemble, place a handful of noodles into a bowl. Add desired amount of sliced boneless shanks, pork knuckles/hocks, sliced Vietnamese ham (Cha Lua/Gio Lua) and 2-3 cubes of pork blood cubes. Ladle in hot broth. Garnish with sliced green onions, yellow/white onion, and cilantro. Serve with a platter of fresh vegetables (bean sprouts, banana blossom, lettuce, etc.), lime/lemon wedges, shrimp paste and sate sauce.</li>
